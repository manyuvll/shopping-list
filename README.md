## Project details

Entirely working on smartphones and pc.

Possibility of creating list by:

The list will show the total price and a delete button.
After creating the list, you can add items to it.
An item has:

Initially done with localstorage, but changed with Vuex to remove duplication of code mainly and make it cleanly.

Please give it a try! :)
